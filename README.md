**RetailFusion-PowerBI-Report:A Comprehensive Retail Sales, Profit, and Customer Experience Dashboard**
                RetailFusion is an advanced Power BI Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard designed to analyze and visualize sales, profit, and customer experience metrics for a retail business. The project converts raw transactional data into actionable insights through interactive reports, structured data modeling, and visualization best practices.

Combine sales, profit, return rates, and customer sentiment into a single analytical environment.
Empower decision-makers to explore trends, identify high-performing categories, and monitor customer satisfaction across multiple regions.
